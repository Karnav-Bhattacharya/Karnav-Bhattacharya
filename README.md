I am in 11th grade now. Actually, no, I am not, per se atleastğŸ˜œ. But who cares? I just love computers and it does what i want it to do. The condition is, it should understand what I am saying, for which i need to code. NGL, sometimes it is frustating to communicate in a whole other language, but totally worth itğŸ˜€
